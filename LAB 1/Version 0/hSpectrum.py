## HSPECTRUM  Quantum Chemistry and the Hydrogen Emission Spectrum
#
# The periodic table is central to chemistry. According to Britannica,
# "Detailed understanding of the periodic system has developed along with
# the quantum theory of spectra and the electronic structure of atoms,
# beginning with the work of Bohr in 1913." In this lab assignment, a
# University of Alberta student explores the Bohr model's accuracy in
# predicting the hydrogen emission spectrum, using observed wavelengths
# from a US National Institute of Standards and Technology database.
