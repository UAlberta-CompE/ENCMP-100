## TSPANALYZE  Geomatics and the Travelling Sales[person] Problem
#
# According to the ISO/TC 211, geomatics is the "discipline concerned
# with the collection, distribution, storage, analysis, processing, [and]
# presentation of geographic data or geographic information." Geomatics
# is associated with the travelling salesman problem (TSP), a fundamental
# computing problem. In this lab assignment, a University of Alberta
# student completes a Python program to analyze, process, and present
# entries, stored in a binary data file, of the TSPLIB, a database
# collected and distributed by the University of Heidelberg.

# instructor and TAs, who gave you compositional assistance.

# After each name, including your own name, enter in parentheses an
# estimate of the person's contributions in percent. Without these
